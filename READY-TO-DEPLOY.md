## 🚀 Deployment Commands

### Step-by-Step

```bash
# Navigate to project
cd /Users/piotrstrychalski/Documents/GitHub/btc

# Login to Railway (opens browser)
railway login
# → Login with: piotr.strychalski@icloud.com

# Create new project
railway init
# → Name: btc-trading-system (or your choice)

# Add PostgreSQL
railway add --plugin postgresql
# → Railway creates DB, sets DATABASE_URL automatically

# Add Redis
railway add --plugin redis
# → Railway creates Redis, sets REDIS_URL automatically

# Deploy Data Validation
cd services/data-validation
railway up
# → Railway builds Docker image and deploys

# Go back to root
cd ../..

# Check deployment status
railway status

# View logs (real-time)
railway logs --service data-validation

# Get service URL
railway domain

# Open Railway dashboard
railway open
```

### Or Use Automated Script

```bash
./deploy-to-railway.sh
```

This script will:
1. Check Railway CLI
2. Verify login
3. Initialize project
4. Add PostgreSQL & Redis
5. Deploy Data Validation
6. Set environment variables
7. Show status

---

## 🧪 Testing After Deployment

### 1. Get Your Service URL

```bash
# Method 1: CLI
railway domain

# Method 2: Dashboard
# Go to https://railway.app/dashboard
# Click your project → data-validation → Settings → Domains
```

### 2. Test Health Endpoint

```bash
export SERVICE_URL="https://your-service.railway.app"

curl $SERVICE_URL/health
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "service": "data-validation",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-05T12:00:00Z",
  "version": "1.0.0"
}
```

### 3. Test Validation

```bash
curl -X POST $SERVICE_URL/validate/ohlcv \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "symbol": "BTC/USDT",
    "timeframe": "5m",
    "data": [
      {
        "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
        "open": 43250.50,
        "high": 43500.00,
        "low": 43200.00,
        "close": 43450.75,
        "volume": 1234.567
      },
      {
        "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:05:00Z",
        "open": 43450.75,
        "high": 43600.00,
        "low": 43400.00,
        "close": 43580.25,
        "volume": 987.654
      }
    ]
  }'
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "valid": true,
  "validated_at": "2025-10-05T12:00:00Z",
  "symbol": "BTC/USDT",
  "data_points": 2,
  "errors": null,
  "warnings": null,
  "statistics": {
    "ge_validation": {...},
    "price_change": {
      "valid": true,
      "max_change_percent": 0.3
    }
  }
}
```

### 4. Test Bad Data (Should Fail)

```bash
curl -X POST $SERVICE_URL/validate/ohlcv \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "symbol": "BTC/USDT",
    "data": [
      {
        "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
        "open": 43250.0,
        "high": 43000.0,
        "low": 43500.0,
        "close": 43450.0,
        "volume": 1234.5
      }
    ]
  }'
```

**Expected:** `"valid": false` with errors about High < Low

### 5. Check Metrics

```bash
curl $SERVICE_URL/metrics
```

**Expected:** Prometheus metrics format

### 6. Check Statistics

```bash
curl $SERVICE_URL/stats?hours=24
```

**Expected:** Validation statistics for last 24 hours

- **Metrics:** CPU, Memory, Network usage
- **Logs:** Real-time application logs
- **Variables:** Environment configuration
- **Settings:** Domain, scaling, billing

### Live Logs

```bash

railway logs --follow

# Last 100 lines
railway logs --tail 100

# Filter by level
railway logs | grep ERROR
```

### Metrics

Railway shows:
- **CPU Usage:** Real-time percentage
- **Memory Usage:** MB used / total
- **Network:** Ingress/Egress
- **Requests:** Count and response times

Plus your Prometheus metrics at `/metrics`!

## 💰 Cost Estimates

### Current Deployment (Data Validation Only)

**Services:**
- PostgreSQL: ~$0-5/month (small DB)
- Redis: ~$0-3/month (minimal usage)
- Data Validation: ~$0-5/month (1 container, low traffic)

**Total: $0-13/month**

Likely **FREE** on Railway's Hobby tier! ($5 credit/month)

### Monitoring Costs

```bash
# Check current usage
railway usage

# See pricing
railway pricing
```

Railway Hobby (FREE):
- $5 credit/month
- 512MB RAM per service
- Shared CPU
- Perfect for development!

## 🎯 Success Criteria

### Deployment Successful If:

- ✅ `railway status` shows "Running"
- ✅ `/health` returns 200 OK
- ✅ `/validate/ohlcv` accepts and validates data
- ✅ Logs show no errors
- ✅ DATABASE_URL connects successfully
- ✅ Metrics are exported

### How to Verify:

```bash
# 1. Status check
railway status | grep data-validation
# Should show: ✓ data-validation | Running

# 2. Health check
curl $(railway domain)/health
# Should return: {"status":"healthy"}

# 3. Database check
railway logs | grep "Database connection established"
# Should show: Database connection established

# 4. Test validation
# (use curl example from Testing section)
# Should return valid JSON response
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting Quick Reference

### Service Won't Start
```bash
railway logs --service data-validation
# Look for: ImportError, Connection errors, Port issues
```

### Database Connection Failed
```bash
railway variables | grep DATABASE_URL
# Should show PostgreSQL URL
# If missing: railway add --plugin postgresql
```

### Out of Memory
```bash
railway status
# Check memory usage
# Solution: Upgrade plan or optimize code
```

### Can't Access Service
```bash
railway domain
# Get correct URL
# Check: Service must be running first
```

### Build Failed
```bash
railway logs --deployment
# Check Docker build logs
# Common: Missing dependencies in requirements.txt
```
